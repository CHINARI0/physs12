<h3>Final Project: UNO Machine</h3>

<p class="margin"></p>

<a>Since I had everything ready, I thought assembling this would be relatively easy. I started by changing the box to use plywood instead of cardboard, have a base, a piece to push down the cards, and a small gap to keep the protoboard in place.</a>

<a>After cutting the box, I soldered the Esp-32 Cam onto the protoboard and that is when everything started going downhill. </a>

<a>The soldered Esp-32 Cam did not connect to my computer at all, which is why I had to drop the camera idea. Since I didn't have too much time by then, I had to use a xiao to control the stepper motor.</a>

<a>Even thought I am pretty sad that I couldn't get my plan to work, I am planning to continue working on this project back home and hopefully finishing it in a way i like.</a>
