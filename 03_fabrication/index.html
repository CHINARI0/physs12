<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>

<a> For the kinetic sculpture, I tried to make a device that shoots out UNO cards to help towards my final project. I went for a design with springs and a wheel to carry the cards up and to shoot them up respectively. I designed the box to fit the specific deck of UNO cards I had. For the first two iterations, I used score but saw that creating all pieces seperately could work better so I changed it according to that. With the final iteration, I cut a few small pieces of wood to attach the motor to the box. I also added a small piece of cardboard to limit how high the cards can get. After these I realised I had to distribute the force from the springs more uniformly, which is why I cut out another piece of cardboard and glued it to the springs. With all of these done, it worked well enough. The only big change I could've done was to make a better way to hold the motor. After measuring the current and voltage, I got approximately 0.18 and 5 volts while working, which would give a resistance of around 27.8 ohms.</a>
