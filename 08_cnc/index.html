<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<a>For this weeks assignment, I collaborated with Sara. For the thing we CNC'd, we used a guitar that she drew in Fusion.</a>

<a>For the cutting part, Kassia helped a lot. With her help, the guitar turned out pretty successfully! </a>

<a>With the wooden guitar, we went to the vaccuum former and tried to vaccuum form a mold. In our first attempt, we forgot to remove the sticker and tried to remove it after the process was done. This failed pretty miserably though, as we accidentally tore a hole. In our second try, we made sure to remove the stickers. We were more successful in this attempt, but while removing the sticker, we thought it was only on one side. Even with the slight mess up on our part, we decided to cast it. </a>

<a>For the casting, we used plaster. We spent around half an hour trying to figure out the ratio. In the end, we managed to get a pretty successful result.</a>
