<h4>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<a>For my 3D printing assignment, I made a card holder. I wanted it to be curved, and I originally wanted it to have 4 layers. With this configuration, the slicer software estimated 10.30 hours. Since lab was already about to be over, I decided to start it and leave it running overnight. Sadly, it failed quite miserably. </a>

<a>After this, I changed my design to half the radius and the amount of layers. This lowered the print time to 3 hours.</a>

<a>For the scanning, I used a TI-84 and the polycam app to capture it. I didn't use it as well as I would've liked, but the TI did show up quite well.</a>
