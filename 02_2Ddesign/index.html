<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

<a> For my box, I decided on a hexagonal design. I didn't want a simple rectangular box, so I figured this would do. While drawing the box, the view reminded me of a turtle which is why I engraved a turtle onto the box. I also engraved the first letter of my name (Ã‡) to add more personalisation. </a>

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

<a>For the tutorial, I went through autodesk's and CAD CAM tutorials's tutorials. I watched the videos and experimented with the concepts in them. After familiarising myself I decided that as preparation for the 3rd pard and as practice, I should create a few simple but fun things. For this purpose, I chose a pencil and a stick and measured them. I chose the pencil because of the conic shape and I chose the stick for its extremely simple shape. <br></a>

<h4>Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

<a>For the items, I chose a drill bit and a screwdriver. I measured these using a calliper and then started to create the 3D assemblies. <br></a>

<image style = "height: 500px; width: 500px;" src = "./Screwdriver OG.jpg"> </image>

<a>For the screwdriver, I drew a sketch using circles for the plastic base and extruded it to make it 3D. After creating the cylindrical plastic part, I made another sketch using a 3 point arc and another circle to rotate and cut the big gap on the screwdriver and its edges. Lastly, I made a cylinder piece and cut two triangles to get the screwdriver shape. <br></a>

<image style = "height: 500px; width: 500px;" src = "./Screwdriver CAD SS.jpg"> </image> <br>

<a>For the Drill bit, I started off by creating a cylinder by extruding a circle. I used chamfer to get the edge of the drill bit. I used coil to create a pattern around the cylinder. I used sweep with a circle to create the first half of the drilling part. I used circular pattern to get the other half. I extruded a triangle to get the pointiness. <br></a>
